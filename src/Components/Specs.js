                            <p>The technology behind NOZE is based on a digital nose sensor (also known as an e-nose). With this sensor, NOZE can precisely detect a wide range of pollutants and chemicals. In contrast, almost all other air quality monitors on the market today use a bundle of off-the-shelf sensors that are limited in what they can detect and can vary widely in quality, accuracy and reliability.</p>

                            <p>The Virus Risk Index is an AI-powered tool built into NOZE to help make indoor spaces safer places to live, work, and visit by monitoring the risk of virus transmission (tracking how conducive the air is to spreading the virus) and the risk of virus presence (tracking the likelihood that the virus is in the air).

                                Note: The Virus Risk Index is not intended to be an alternative to precautionary measures or laboratory testing.</p>

To calculate this score, our AI analyzes five things: Airborne Volatiles related to the Coronavirus and Influenza, Particulate Matter, Temperature, Humidity and Carbon Dioxide.y</p>
